Version 0.4 - IN DEVELOPMENT
------------------------
Enhancements:
* Nicer pretty-printing of comments and PIs before and after the root
  element.
* Repeat calls to declaration() are now silently ignored.
* Namespace scope is now handled automatically, so you no longer need
  to call end_ns() yourself (it's now a no-op), which makes it harder
  to screw up.

Bug fixes:
* XMLSyntaxError is now raised when declaration() is called too late,
  instead of writing an illegal declaration in the document.

Version 0.3 - 2009-06-01
------------------------
Enhancements:
* Unit tests are now included in the package.
* Added much needed docstrings and some comments to the code.

Bug fixes:
* Namespaced attributes weren't serialized correctly.
* Fixed handling of nsmap, to retain namespace prefix mappings
  when working with lxml trees.

Version 0.2 - 2009-05-10
------------------------
New features:
* The element() method now supports Element instances.
* Added tostring() utility function for serializing an Element
  instance to a string.
* Removed padding spaces in comments


Enhancements:
* Escaping/encoding of attribute values and character data is now
  a lot faster than before
* Attribute sorting also a lot faster
* Additional minor speed improvements.

Bug fixes:
* The README, LICENSE and setup.py files were missing in version 0.1.
* Fixed a bug that meant attributes were lost when attribute sorting
  was turned off.
* Removed broken duplicate declaration of the comment() method
* Calling the data() method with whitespace-only data will now be
  ignored if pretty_print=True
